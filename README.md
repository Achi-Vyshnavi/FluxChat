FluxChat is a real-time no-code workflow builder that enables users to create, manage, and collaborate on custom workflows visually, without writing any code. I led the frontend architecture, designed modular components, implemented real-time updates, and optimized performance to deliver an intuitive, scalable, and responsive platform.

🌟 Overview:
FluxChat allows teams to visually design workflows using drag-and-drop elements, connect steps, and automate processes. Users can collaborate in real-time, seeing changes instantly. This project demonstrates my experience in scalable UI design, real-time collaboration, and frontend performance optimization.
